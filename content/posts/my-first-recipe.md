## Ingredients

- 5 lbs of tangerines
- enough water to partially cover the sliced tangerines
- 5 cups sugar

1. slice peel-on tangerines into rounds about 1/4 inch thick, removing and saving seeds. (You can discard the top of the peel; also don't use any damaged or dirty peels)

1. Put the tangerine slices into a pot, and add water to about 1 inch from the top of the tangerines (keep most of the peel)

1. put all seeds in cloth or a tea strainer and add to the tangerines

1. boil for 20 minutes

1. add the sugar and boil the mixture until temp of 220 (may be close to an hour). Stir sometimes while it’s boiling so the bottom doesn’t burn.

1. put in clean glass containers and cool on counter for an hour or two

1. refrigerate

This is also good with a few Meyer lemons added, remove seeds and include with tangerine seeds.
