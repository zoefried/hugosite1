## Tangerine Preserves

5 lbs of tangerines\
enough water to partially cover the sliced tangerines\
5 cups sugar

- slice peel-on tangerines into rounds about 1/4 inch thick, removing and saving seeds. (You can discard the top of the peel; also don't use any damaged or dirty peels)
- Put the tangerine slices into a pot, and add water to about 1 inch from the top of the tangerines
  (keep most of the peel)
- put all seeds in cloth or a tea strainer and add to the tangerines
- boil for 20 minutes
- add the sugar and boil the mixture until temp of 220 (may be close to an hour). Stir sometimes while it’s boiling so the bottom doesn’t burn.
- put in clean glass containers and cool on counter for an hour or two
- refrigerate

This is also good with a few Meyer lemons added, remove seeds and include with tangerine seeds.

Add juice of two lemons plus enough water to make 8 cups and all the sugar and the salt. Boil until the preserves pass the wrinkle test.
